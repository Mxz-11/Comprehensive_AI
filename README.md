# Comprehensive_AI
An end-to-end AI system integrating a conversational chatbot, image recognition, speech processing, and image generation using Hugging Face models and Gradio interface.

## AI Multimodal System with Chatbot, Vision, Speech, and Image Generation

This project is a comprehensive, multimodal AI system that combines several state-of-the-art deep learning models to deliver a seamless and intelligent user interaction experience. At its core, the system features a powerful conversational agent based on **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct**, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) developed by Meta and hosted on Hugging Face. 

The system further incorporates:

- 🖼️ **Object Detection and Recognition** using pretrained vision models
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for human-like audio responses
- 🎙️ **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** for speech-to-text conversion
- 🎨 **Image Generation** (bonus feature) through natural language prompts
- 🖥️ **Interactive Graphical Interface** built with Gradio for intuitive use

All components are integrated into a single user-friendly interface, allowing users to chat via text or voice, upload images for analysis, listen to AI responses, and even generate AI art—all in one place.

### 🚀 Features

- Chat in real time with the AI assistant powered by **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct**
- Upload an image and get labeled object predictions
- Hear the AI's responses through speech synthesis
- Speak to the AI system via voice input using ASR
- Generate creative images from text prompts (optional feature)

### 🧰 Tools & Frameworks

- Hugging Face Transformers (LLM, ViT, Wav2Vec2, SpeechT5)
- Gradio for GUI and interactivity
- Python, PyTorch
- Google Colab (for cloud execution)
